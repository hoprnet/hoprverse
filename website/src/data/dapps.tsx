        Visualizer draws a graphical representation of the HOPR network, showing
        all the nodes and the connections between them.
        <br />
        <br />
        Use the interface to toggle between two modes: the first uses subgraph
        data to visualize payment channels, the second by getting information
        from the nodes themselves.

        A proof of concept dApp to demonstrate multihop messages. Send a message
        from a node, which will boomerang back to the sender after passing
        through the HOPR network.

        Learn how to build this dApp and whatâ€™s going on under the hood by

        Chat should be private but it isn&apos;t. Your identity is exposed,

        pay you for making the internet more secure.
